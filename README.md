# Eclipse Starter for Jakarta EE
This is a sample application generated by the Eclipse Foundation starter for Jakarta EE.

You can run the application by executing the following command from the directory where this file resides. Please ensure you have installed a [Java SE 8+ implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8) appropriate for your Jakarta EE version and runtime choice (we have tested with Java SE 8, Java SE 11 and Java SE 17). Note, the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) is already included in the project, so a Maven install is not actually needed. You may first need to execute `chmod +x mvnw`.

```
./mvnw clean package wildfly:dev
```

Once the runtime starts, you can access the project at http://localhost:8080/jakartaee-hello-world.

You can also run the project via Docker. To build the Docker image, execute the following commands from the directory where this file resides. Please ensure you have installed a [Java SE 8+ implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8) appropriate for your Jakarta EE version/runtime choice and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (we have tested with Java SE 8, Java SE 11 and Java SE 17). Note, the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) is already included in the project, so a Maven install is not actually needed. You may first need to execute `chmod +x mvnw`.

```
./mvnw clean package
docker build -t jakartaee-hello-world:v1 .
```

You can then run the Docker image by executing:

```
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 jakartaee-hello-world:v1
```

Once the runtime starts, you can access the project at http://localhost:8080/jakartaee-hello-world.


## Wildfly Maven Plugin

```

* mvn wildfly:deploy

    > The wildfly:deploy goal deploys the application to the running WildFly Application Server

* mvn wildfly:deploy-artifact

    > The wildfly:deploy-artifact goal deploys an arbitrary artifact to the running WildFly.

* mvn wildfly:dev 

    > The wildfly:dev goal will start WildFly and deploy your application. If the jboss-home property is not set, a server will be provisioned. The source directories will be watched for changes. If a change occurs, additional Maven goals may be executed before a possible redeploy of your deployment.

* mvn wildfly:redeploy

    > The wildfly:redeploy goal will redeploy your application if and only if the application has already been deployed to the application server.

* mvn wildfly:undeploy

    > The wildfly:undeploy goal will undeploy your application from the from the running application server if the application has already been deployed.

* mvn wildfly:run

    > The wildfly:run goal will run WildFly and deploy your application. If the jboss-home property is not set, a server will be provisioned.

* mvn wildfly:start

    > The wildfly:start goal will start a WildFly. If the jboss-home property is not set, a server will be provisioned. The server will continue to run until the shutdown goal is executed, a shutdown management operation has been issued or the process is killed.

* mvn wildfly:shutdown

    > The wildfly:shutdown goal will shutdown a running WildFly.
